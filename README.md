# Snake Xenzia Game

This is a classic implementation of the Snake Xenzia game using Python Turtle graphics library.

## Features
- Control a snake on the screen to eat food and grow longer.
- Avoid running into the walls or colliding with your own tail.
- Keep track of the score as you eat more food and grow longer.
- Display game over message when the game ends.
- Support for adjustable game speed.
- Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Randomly generate food on the screen for the snake to eat.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (should be included with Python installation)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).
3. Run the snake.py file using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Python.
4. Enjoy playing Snake Xenzia!

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake will move continuously in the current direction until you change its direction.
- Eat the food that appears on the screen to grow longer and earn points.
- Avoid running into the walls or colliding with your own tail, as this will end the game.
- The game speed can be adjusted at the beginning of the game by changing the `DELAY` constant in the game.py file.

## Credits
- Turtle graphics library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) for providing the graphics and animation capabilities for the game.
- Inspiration for the Snake Xenzia game concept goes to the original Snake game developed in the 1970s.
